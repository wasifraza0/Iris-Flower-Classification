# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project is an implementation of machine learning algorithms to classify the Iris flowers. The Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset in machine learning, contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of 150 iris flowers, classified into three different species.

The project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms in solving a real-world problem and provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model used. The algorithms used in this project are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.

# Prerequisites

The following packages and libraries are required to run the code:

**numpy

**pandas

**matplotlib

**seaborn

**scikit-learn

# Results and Conclusion

The results of this project demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of accuracy. However, further improvements can be made to the models by tuning their parameters and using other evaluation metrics.

This project serves as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring the classification of iris flowers using machine learning algorithms and provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each algorithm used.
